#Zen of API - API Retirement process

APIs should more and more be understood as products which have life cycle. Idea for new API can be innovated at Zen API Jam or in other occasions. After design and implementation of API, it will be taken into use. At some point your API will retire and become obsolete. Retiring API needs to be planned to minimize surprised for API consumer and to maximize developer love towards your organization and products.
