### 2. Connect API development to business strategy

Challenge: Just building APIs without solid reason is waste of time and money. Often the reasoning comes from business strategy. This is the case more often nowadays. Challenge is to connect customers, API developers and your business strategy experts to work towards same goal - which is to satisfy customer needs. 

Solution: Zen API approach utilizes Lean canvas based API model Canvas for identifying key elements for your APIs and create accurate business plans fast. Often best approach is to organize 1 or 2 days long Zen API Jam to build suitable business models and API mockups to test plans with selected customers. Zen API Jam is facilitated workshop build around service design tools and practices.
